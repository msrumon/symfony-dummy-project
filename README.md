# A Dummy Project in **Symfony**

I have created this dummy repository to demonstrate an issue: separation of logic for rendering and processing forms. But it seems like it's impossible to separate these two in **Symfony** style. I hope someone will explain me. Please create issues to discuss more.

## How to run

- Clone this repository (or download as ZIP archive).
- Navigate into the project directory.
- Install the dependencies: `composer install`.
- Spin up the server: `php -S localhost:8080`.

Open a browser and go to `localhost:8080/blog`. You should see the form.
